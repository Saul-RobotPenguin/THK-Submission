  <h3>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
      Hey! Welcome to my website. My name is Saul Calleja and I'm currently teaching myself how to program and style websites. I'm 20 years old and currently living in the Bronx, been here my entire life. I was always interested in programming to the point where I majored in Computer Science during my short time at a Community College. I would teach myself code, not implementing it into my programs but rather just take a course and finish it. It was only during quarantine when I realized I have just been wasting my time working and not developing my skills, so I  yanked open my laptop and started (still am!) working on myself.
    </p>

  <h3>My Reason For Wanting To Join THK</h2>
    <p>
      I would consider myself a person who's trying to teach themselves how to code. The thing is, that you often run into bumps during your learning,  you can't help but be stuck on parts that take you days to understand because it isn't being explained right or you just can't find the right place to ask for clarification. I find myself getting myself into these situations frequently.
      I know some programming languages but that knowledge only consists of the fundamentals. I would love to get assistance from this program to hone my skills. To not only take my skills to another whole level but to also guide me into what I should expect in the future. I need someone to inspect my code and tell me what I'm doing wrong rather than posting it on StackOverflow where the best answer is somewhat condescending.
      I want to have a person listen to my queries and respond to them, fully understanding that I'm still a newbie to the whole web development process. I essentially, want to hone my learning and I honestly believe
      that the people at the Knowledge House are the key.
    </p>
